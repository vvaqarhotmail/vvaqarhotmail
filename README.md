# 👋 Hi, I’m Waqar Hussain (@vvaqarhotmail)

Greetings from **Karachi, Pakistan** – a city where the traffic is wild, but the tech scene is thriving!

- 👀 I’m deeply interested in **building scalable web apps**, **AI/ML**, and **data analytics**. When I’m not solving problems with code, you can find me exploring how these technologies can make the world a little bit more awesome. I believe every problem has a solution – sometimes it just needs a little JavaScript (or a lot of it).
  
- 🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into **cloud computing**, **deep learning**, and **serverless architectures**. The future is serverless, and I want to be there when it happens. I’m also exploring ways to integrate machine learning into business solutions, because why not let the machines do all the work?

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **innovative data-driven projects**, **AI applications**, and **open-source contributions** that solve real-world problems. If you're working on something interesting (and possibly world-changing), hit me up. I promise, I bring more than just coffee to the table – I bring solutions, collaboration, and maybe even a bad joke or two.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can DM me on GitHub, but if you prefer to send an email, feel free to reach out to me at **waqar.irshad.hussain@hotmail.com** or **vvaqarhussain@hotmail.com**. If I don’t reply immediately, it’s probably because I’m buried under lines of code or sipping chai (not necessarily in that order).

- 😄 **Pronouns**: **He/Him** – I’m always open to collaboration, learning new things, and occasionally making bad puns. Let’s make tech fun again!

- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I’m fascinated by space tech. If I wasn’t coding, I’d probably be trying to figure out how to send a Python script to Mars. My ultimate goal is to combine space exploration with AI/ML. Think of it as *SpaceX*, but with a lot more data and maybe fewer rockets.

## 🚀 Professional Journey

I currently serve as the **Business Unit Head at a Software House** (yes, I know – impressive title, right?). I oversee a team of exceptional developers, data scientists, and business analysts, ensuring we deliver top-notch solutions while navigating the ever-changing world of software development. My role requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to manage people (and occasionally, office snacks).

**Key Experiences**:

- **Junior Data Analyst** at **Decagon Consulting** (Australia) – Here, I got my hands dirty with data engineering, analytics, and visualization. I worked on projects like **Customer Segmentation** and **Fall Detection using Smartphone Sensors**, where I learned that **data doesn't lie**, but it definitely tries to confuse you sometimes.
  
- **Head of Tech Team** at **FAST Data Science Society (FDSS)** – I’m not just about tech. I’ve also led projects, mentored students, and organized workshops. Leading the tech team was a mix of coding, teaching, and occasionally pretending to know all the answers during meetings.

- **Data Engineering and Analytics Experience** – From **data visualization in Power BI** to building **machine learning models**, I’ve explored the depths of data. My expertise spans across tools like **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**, and I can proudly say that I can talk data for hours (whether you want me to or not).

- **Certifications**: I’ve earned certifications in **Data Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data-Driven Decision Making**, which are my badges of honor in the tech world. I wear them proudly like a cape (not that I need one... but it helps).

## 📈 Current Projects

- **Web App Development**: I’m currently building a **web app** for a company that integrates tools like **Shopify**, **Dialpad**, and **RingCentral**. The goal is to make the work of salespeople as seamless as possible – who doesn’t love smooth workflows?

- **Machine Learning & AI**: I'm actively experimenting with **deep learning** models and **AI-powered applications**. If it's about making data smarter, I’m probably involved somehow. My mission is to make ML models that not only predict but also provide actionable insights that businesses can actually use.

## 📫 How to Reach Me

You can always **DM me on GitHub** or email me directly at **waqar.irshad.hussain@hotmail.com** or **vvaqarhussain@hotmail.com**. Whether it's about **open-source collaborations**, **AI challenges**, or you just need someone to brainstorm with, I’m here to help (or at least try).

## Let's Build Something Together!

I believe that collaboration makes the world go round (along with coffee and a good sense of humor). If you're passionate about tech, innovation, or solving real problems, let's connect and see how we can create something awesome.

P.S. If you got through this without cringing at my bad jokes, you're my kind of person.
